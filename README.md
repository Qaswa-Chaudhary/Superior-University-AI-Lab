Python Mini Projects Collection
This repository contains a collection of Python-based mini projects, ranging from classic games to data analysis and agent-based systems. Each project showcases different Python programming concepts, including basic scripting, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and algorithmic design.

1. Hangman Game - Python Mini Project
This project implements a Python-based Hangman game where players guess a number between 1 and 100. The game provides a simple interface for inputting guesses, and players receive feedback until they either guess the correct number or run out of lives.

Features:
Number guessing game.
Input-based gameplay.
Win or lose feedback system.

2. FizzBuzz Game - Python OOP Mini Project
This project contains a Python implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game prints numbers from 1 to N, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

Features:
Object-Oriented Design.
Customizable range for the FizzBuzz game.
Clear, simple game logic.

3. Movie Budget Analysis - Python Mini Project
This project performs a simple analysis of a list of movies, calculating the average budget of the films and identifying high-budget films that exceed this average. The program also allows users to add their own movie data before performing the analysis.

Features:
Input handling for movie budget data.
Calculation of average movie budget.
Identification of high-budget films.

4. Simple Reflex Agent - Python OOP Mini Project
This project implements a Simple Reflex Agent that controls the heating system in rooms based on the current and desired temperatures. If the current temperature is lower than the desired one, the agent turns on the heater, and if it is higher, the heater is turned off.

Features:
Object-Oriented Design.
Reflex agent logic for controlling temperature.
Automated decision-making for the heating system.

5. Model-Based Agent - Python OOP Mini Project
This project builds upon the Simple Reflex Agent, implementing a Model-Based Agent that controls the heating system of rooms by remembering past actions and current temperatures. It uses this history (model) to decide whether to turn the heater on or off based on the desired temperature.

Features:
Object-Oriented Design.
Model-based decision-making.
History-based temperature control.

6. LUHN Algorithm Credit Card Validator - Python Mini Project
This project implements the LUHN Algorithm in Python to validate credit card numbers. The LUHN Algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to verify identification numbers such as credit card numbers, ensuring they are valid based on a calculated checksum.

Features:
LUHN Algorithm implementation.
Credit card number validation.
Simple Python-based checksum calculation.

7. Remove Punctuation from User Input - Python Mini Project
This Python script removes punctuation from a user-provided input string without using any built-in string or list methods like remove(). It iterates over the input, checks for punctuation, and creates a new string with the punctuation removed.

Features:
Loop-based text processing.
Conditional check for punctuation.
Input handling for removing punctuation.

8. Alphabetical Text Sorter - Python Mini Project
This Python script sorts the characters of a given word or text in alphabetical order without using the built-in sort() function. It manually compares characters and reorders them using basic swapping and comparison logic.

Features:
Manual sorting algorithm (without sort()).
Case-insensitive sorting.
Input handling for text reordering.
